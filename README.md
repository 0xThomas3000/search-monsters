# A basic React Web App

The project's name: "searching-monsters".<br/>
The project's link: [https://tuanit168.github.io/searching-monsters/](https://tuanit168.github.io/searching-monsters/)

## Description

The project was built with React library.<br/>
It has a basic feature which is "search", it helps find some elements with the names that nearly match with the keywords we typed in the search field.<br/> 
We did the project with React library for better performance(to ensure the whole page won't get reloaded again every time we're doing the search).
